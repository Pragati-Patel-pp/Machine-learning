# Machine-learning
This repository consists of all the programming assignment solutions (programming language: Octvae/MATLAB) of Machine learning cousre offered by Stanford university on Coursera (instructor- Andrew Ng). Assignments are based on problems regarding:
1. Linear regression with one and multiple variables.
2. Logistic regression (regularization).
3. Neural Networks.
4. Support vector machines.
5. Dimesionality reduction (k-means and PCA algorithms).
6. Anamoly detection and recommender systems.
